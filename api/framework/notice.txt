This module is dedicated to a side project in progress known as "wyvern",
which is a dynamic spring-like HTTP routing framework built upon Spark-Java,
Kotlin-Coroutines, and several DSLs.

Until this module is fully featured as a means of simplifying it's development,
I've left the commons module of the project attached to it.
